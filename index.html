			<div class="faqs2">
				<h3>What inspired, Ankur Warikoo to add the Monthly LIVE sessions as part of the course?</h3>
				<p>Pre-recorded 90 minute course content is great because it allows the student to learn at their own pace. However, during that learning phase, any clarifications or questions that may arise are often left unanswered.
				Which is where live sessions come in. These sessions build ON TOP of the recorded content so that students can come with their questions and learn from the questions of others in the LIVE session.</p>
